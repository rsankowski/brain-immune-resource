A comprehensive resource on single-cell RNA-Sequencing of brain immune cells from humans and mice, observed under normal and pathological conditions. The featured data has been published in peer-reviewed journals by the Institute of Neuropathology at the University Clinic of Freiburg.

The primary goal of this resource is to facilitate the widespread dissemination and accessibility of these data, aligning with the [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) criteria, enabling researchers and interested parties to utilize these findings effectively.
